{NAME_2}:  welcome to ReddiPod I'm your co-host Kelden, and we're coming at you live from the comfort of my home on this lovely Tuesday morning – June 4th, approximately 12:17 AM.

Emily:  Ahahahaha! Good one, Kelden! And a late night for us tonight... or should I say early in the morning?

Kelden:   yeah, we're getting ahead of ourselves here! Alright so our first topic comes from Apple enthusiast community – Reddit's r/apple subreddit. So let me tell you what caught my attention; Justin Long is back promoting Windows on Arm PCs

Emily:  Whoa, hold up - the I'm a Mac guy? That takes me way back to those old ad campaigns... I loved him as that quirky character!

Kelden:   yeah, he's still got it. And now he's switching sides – promoting Windows on Arm PCs with all these hilarious ads taking aim at macOS notifications

Emily:  Ahahahaha, oh man, this is gold! I can see why people are loving the nostalgia factor here... and those comments on Reddit? Oh boy, they're having a field day!

Kelden:   yeah, it's been lit over there. And you know what struck me – Microsoft missed an opportunity by not continuing their I'm a PC campaign after 2007

Emily:  That's so true - I mean, Justin Long was such a big part of that brand identity... but hey, maybe they're trying to make up for lost time now?

Kelden:   exactly! And it got me thinking – what do you think about the whole notification thing on macOS vs. Windows

Emily:  Oh man, I'm with Apple all day on this one - their notifications are still way more elegant and streamlined than anything Microsoft's come up with... but hey, at least they're trying to improve now?

Kelden:   yeah no kidding! Alright moving on – our next topic comes from the Epic Games vs. Apple lawsuit saga

Emily:  Whoa, this is getting juicy - so a judge wants all of Apple's decision-making documents regarding app store policies and fees... what do you think they're hiding?

Kelden:   yeah it looks like Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers isn't messing around! And I'm with her on that – we need transparency here

Emily:  Absolutely - this is all about accountability, right? Apple's gotta come clean and show their working... no more smoke and mirrors.

Kelden:  Alright moving on to our final topic for tonight... another one from the r/apple subreddit

Emily:  Okay! So what've we got here? Ah yeah, it looks like there was a correction regarding M2 iPad Air's GPU count - originally listed as 10-core but now revised to an 8-core

Kelden:   oh boy, Apple and their specs... so they're saying all performance claims are still accurate despite the change

Emily:  Hmmph! That sounds like a whole lot of spin control going on there. I mean, come on - if you can't get your own spec sheet right, how do we trust anything else?

Kelden:   yeah no kidding... and what's with Apple always having to clarify things after the fact?

Emily:  Good question! It seems like they're more concerned about damage control than transparency. I mean, wouldn't it be better just to get it right in the first place instead of trying to spin their way out of trouble later on?

Kelden:   yeah and what's with all these mistakes... are we starting to see a pattern here? 

Emily:  Oh man, you think so too?! It does seem like Apple has been having some issues lately - from the iPhone batterygate saga to now this M2 iPad Air GPU mix-up. Maybe they need to step up their quality control game?

Kelden:   yeah maybe... alright that's all for tonight folks! Thanks for tuning in

Emily:  Yeah, thanks everyone who joined us on ReddiPod today - it was a wild ride discussing those Apple topics with you guys. Don't forget to follow the original posters and commenters from Reddit whose threads sparked these conversations; @Garrett_J_Film, Jhamilton02, and Electronic-Bed-6192... until next time!

Kelden:   indeed – we'll catch you all on the flip side
