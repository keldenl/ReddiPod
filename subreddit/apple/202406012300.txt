KAI: 10–55 PM, and welcome to ReddiPod – the podcast where we dive into the most talked-about topics on Reddit. I'm your co-host KAI
ELIZA: 10–55 PM! Nice timing, KAI! And yeah, folks, that's right - we're diving into some juicy stuff tonight. I'm ELIZA, and alongside my partner in crime here, KAI, we'll be tackling the most popular threads from the Apple subreddit. So grab your favorite snack, get comfy, and let's jump in!
KAI:  so what do you think about this whole M2 iPad Air downgrade thing?
ELIZA: ouch, that is a bummer, right? I mean, who wants to buy an iPad thinking it has one spec only to find out it got downgraded without any warning. And the fact that Apple was advertising a 10-core GPU as recently as May 21st just adds insult to injury. It's like they're trying to pull some kind of fast one on us, you know?
KAI:  yeah exactly! I mean, what even is the point of marketing it with those specs if you're gonna change them later
ELIZA: 100% agree with that. And don't get me wrong, a few percentage points in Geekbench scores might not seem like a huge deal to some people, but for folks who are actually using these devices, it's a big difference. I mean, what about all the content creators and professionals out there who rely on those extra cores? It's like Apple is basically saying, "Hey, we know you're gonna be upset when we change this, so let's just do it quietly."
KAI:  yeah, exactly! And don't even get me started on how ridiculous it is that they can just quietly downgrade the specs without any warning
ELIZA:  oh man, I'm with you there. It's like they think their customers are just gonna be okay with being duped into buying a product based on false advertising. I mean, what if someone had already bought an M2 iPad Air thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread, only to find out later that it's not even as powerful as the one from last year? That's some shady stuff right there
KAI:  and you know who else is getting screwed over here – those poor souls who got ripped off by buying a 10-core GPU M2 iPad Air thinking they were gonna get that extra power
ELIZA:  ugh, don't even get me started on them. I mean, it's not just about the money; it's about trust too. If Apple can't be trusted to keep their promises and advertise accurately, then what are we supposed to do? It's like, come on, guys – you're a multi-billion-dollar company! Can't you at least try to maintain some level of integrity?
KAI:  I know right? And the comments section is full of people who got ripped off by this whole ordeal. Like that one guy @throwmeaway1784 who spotted the change in Geekbench scores and was like "aha, figured it out!"
ELIZA:  yeah! That's exactly what happened with me too – I saw those Geekbench scores and thought to myself, "hold up, something fishy is going on here." And then when I dug deeper, oh boy... It's like Apple just got caught red-handed trying to pull one over on us.
KAI:  so what do you think about the whole tool theft ring that was busted in DC?
ELIZA:  wow, that story is wild! I mean, $5 million worth of tools stolen and then shipped back to China for resale – it's like a real-life heist movie! And can we talk about how organized this operation must have been? It's not just some random guy stealing stuff off the street; there was clearly a whole network involved.
KAI:  yeah, I know what you mean... so many people are saying that law enforcement is just too incompetent or uncaring to even bother investigating these kinds of crimes
ELIZA:  ugh, don't even get me started on that! It's like, come on, police departments – this isn't rocket science. You've got a whole department dedicated to solving property crime and yet they can't be bothered to take action until someone makes it public? It's so frustrating for the victims who are left dealing with insurance claims and financial losses while these thieves get away scot-free
KAI:  yeah... I mean, what do you think is going on here? Are we looking at a systemic issue or just some bad apples in certain departments
ELIZA:  hmm, that's a great question. I think it's probably a combination of both – there are definitely some corrupt cops out there who don't care about doing their job properly, but also, the system as a whole seems to prioritize budget increases over actual crime-solving. It's like they're more concerned with looking good on paper than actually making a difference in people's lives
KAI:  and you know what really gets me is that these thieves are just getting away scot-free
ELIZA:  exactly! I mean, it's not like they're some small-time crooks who got caught up in the system; this was an organized operation with clear intent to commit fraud. And yet, because of our broken justice system or lack thereof, those responsible get off scot-free while the victims are left holding the bag
KAI:  yeah... and don't even get me started on how they're shipping these tools back to China for resale
ELIZA:  oh man, that's like a whole other level of organized crime! I mean, it's not just about stealing stuff; it's about setting up an entire supply chain to sell stolen goods. And who knows where those tools are ending up – maybe in the hands of some unsuspecting contractor or DIYer who has no idea they're using stolen equipment
KAI:  yeah... and what really gets me is that these thieves are targeting specific communities, like tradespeople
ELIZA:  exactly! It's not just random theft; it's targeted. They know which groups to hit because those people need the tools for their work or livelihoods. And then they get away with it while those same people have to deal with the financial loss and stress of having their equipment stolen
KAI:  so, what do you think about this iOS 18 update that's supposed to bring back some classic iMessage features?
ELIZA:  oh man, I'm all for it! Bring on the shooting star effect and laser sounds – those were iconic! And can we talk about how long overdue it is for Apple to give us more control over our notifications? Like, who doesn't want to turn off message reaction notifications or schedule sending messages? It's crazy that these features have been available in other apps but not iMessage
KAI:  yeah... I mean, what really gets me is the lack of archiving and searching capabilities within iMessage
ELIZA:  ugh, don't even get me started! It's like they're trying to make us lose our minds. Can you imagine having a conversation with someone and not being able to find that one specific message from three months ago? Or worse, losing an entire chat thread because it got deleted by accident?!
KAI:  yeah... I mean, Apple should really step up their game in terms of search functionality
ELIZA:  totally agree! It's like they're stuck in the Stone Age or something. With all the AI and machine learning tech out there, you'd think they could come up with a decent searching algorithm for iMessage by now
KAI:  yeah... anyway, that's it for tonight folks – thanks for tuning in to ReddiPod
