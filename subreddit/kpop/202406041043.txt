Kelden: 10:37 AM on a Tuesday, and we're kicking off another episode of ReddiPod.

Emily: ouch, early morning for us today Kelden! But hey, the coffee's gonna be good, right? Alright, so what've we got lined up for our listeners this week?

Kelden: 3 topics from kpop subreddit that are trending and making waves online... first one is about SM Entertainment denying rumors of NCT members Haechan and Johnny engaging in prostitution, drugs or other illegal activities.

Emily: ouch, heavy stuff right off the bat! So, what's your take on this Kelden? You think it was just a bunch of false accusations being spread around like wildfire, or do you have some doubts about SM Entertainment's denials?

Kelden:  Well Emily, I'm gonna go ahead and say that I don't believe these rumors for one second. It seems to me they're just another example of the toxic culture surrounding K-pop idols

Emily: 100% agree with you there! The way fans can turn on each other so quickly is wild – it's like a never-ending cycle of drama and speculation. And let's be real, SM Entertainment has had their fair share of controversies in the past... I'm not saying they're guilty or anything, but maybe this whole ordeal just seems too convenient to me? What do you think about Haechan and Johnny themselves though – how must it feel for them to have these allegations floating around out there?

Kelden:  Yeah, that's a good point. And honestly Emily, can we imagine what those guys are going through right now? Like waking up every morning with their careers on the line because of some false rumors online...

Emily:  ugh, it gives me chills just thinking about it! I mean, these idols work so hard to build their reputation and then something like this comes along and threatens to destroy everything. And you're right, it's not even a real scandal – they didn't do anything wrong in the first place! It's all just a bunch of speculation and hearsay...

Kelden:  Exactly!  They deserve our support and understanding during these times

Emily:  absolutely Kelden! I mean, let this be a reminder to everyone that words have power, especially online. We need to think before we post or share something because it can really affect people's lives in ways you never intended...

Kelden:  And on the other side of things, some fans are saying they hope these guys take care of their mental health during all of this

Emily:  yeah! That part broke my heart. I mean, we always talk about how idols have it tough with pressures to perform and maintain a certain image... but now add in dealing with false rumors like this? It's just too much for anyone to handle alone. We need to be supporting them through these times instead of tearing each other down

Kelden:  Agreed! So let's move on the next topic, which is ATEEZ taking their first win on SBS M The Show...

Emily:  yay! Congrats are in order for those guys! I've been following ATEEZ since they debuted and it's amazing to see them finally getting some recognition. What do you think about this whole win thing – does it mean a lot to K-pop fans or is it just another notch on the belt?

Kelden:  Well, Emily, i believe winning an award like that shows dedication and hard work...

Emily:  absolutely! I love seeing idols put in so much effort into their craft. And ATEEZ has been killing the game with those intense performances – they deserve every bit of recognition for it. But what do you think about this whole win phenomenon? Is there too much emphasis on winning vs just making good music and entertaining fans?

Kelden:  I don't know, Emily... maybe a little bit?

Emily:  yeah! It's like we're always comparing ourselves to others instead of focusing on our own growth. And sometimes it feels like the win becomes more important than actually enjoying the art itself – does that make sense?

Kelden:  Yeah, I think so. But hey at least ATEEZ is making waves and getting recognized for their hard work...

Emily:  exactly! Let's celebrate those wins while also remembering to appreciate the music on its own merit rather than just chasing awards or recognition. What do you make of fans celebrating this win online – are they being genuine in their congratulations, or are there some who might be jumping on the bandwagon?

Kelden:  I think it's a mix...

Emily:  yeah! There'll always be those die-hard stans and casual fans alike sharing congrats messages. But hey, as long as we're celebrating ATEEZ's achievement in general, that's what matters – right? Alright, next topic up is ARTMS' new dance version of Virtual Angel...

Kelden:  Oh boy...

Emily:  haha! What do you think about this one Kelden? I mean, the background visuals are still giving me seizures just watching it. Are they doing that on purpose or what?!

Kelden:  Yeah, like why would anyone intentionally make something so seizure-inducing?

Emily:  exactly! It's not even a good kind of edgy or artistic – it's just plain confusing and annoying to watch. And don't get me started on the epilepsy warnings... I mean come on, guys, we're trying to enjoy your music here, not have an anxiety attack

Kelden:  Yeah, like what was going through their minds when they decided this would be a good idea?

Emily:  probably something along the lines of oh look at us being edgy and cool without actually thinking about how it affects people... I mean, we get that ARTMS wants to stand out in some way, but come on!

Kelden:  And what's with all these seizure-inducing visuals?

Emily:  right?! It feels like they're just trying too hard to be avant-garde and artistic without actually considering the impact it has. I mean, can't we have a dance video that looks nice AND doesn't give me seizures?

Kelden:  Yeah... maybe ARTMS should take some notes from other groups who are doing more tasteful visuals

Emily:  amen to that! Some of these K-pop groups do an amazing job with their choreo and music videos – it's all about balance, you know? Not too much flashiness or over-the-top stuff. Just good ol' fashioned entertainment

Kelden:  Alright Emily, I think we've covered enough drama for today...

Emily:  haha! Yeah, let's wrap things up before our listeners have a seizure from all the controversy What do you say – shall we give some shoutouts to those Reddit posters who started this whole conversation? @ImGonnaLickYourLeg and others

Kelden:
