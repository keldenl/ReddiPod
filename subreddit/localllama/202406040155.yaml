description: They  discuss the feasibility of creating an open-source AI model better
  than GPT-4, and explore alternative solutions like building applications with existing
  models. They also cover a one-line replacement for OpenAI's llama.cpp and Llamanet,
  which allows managing multiple servers without extra setup or knowledge about LLMS.
  Finally, they touch on the Yi-1.5-34B model being ranked highest in an Apache 2.0
  leaderboard.
