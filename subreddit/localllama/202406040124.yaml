description: ' This week, they''re discussing diffusion-based program synthesis using
  neural models on syntax trees of any context-free grammar. They also explore the
  Bug In Code Stack benchmark and its implications for large language models'' ability
  to find syntactic bugs. Finally, they discuss a new text-to-speech model developed
  by Cartesia AI that shows significant improvements over transformers.'
