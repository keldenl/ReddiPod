Kelden: 3:02 PM on a beautiful Tuesday, June 4th...

Emily: 2024 - the perfect day to dive into some tech talk with our favorite subreddit topics. So, Kelden, which topic are we starting off with? The Ikea Roblox store or something else entirely?

Kelden:  Ahahahaha! Yeah I'm excited about this one too Emily! Alright so first up...

Emily: ouch, slow down there buddy! Let's take a deep breath and dive into the world of IKEA hiring workers for their online Roblox store. This is actually pretty wild - £13.15 per hour to work in a virtual environment? What do you think Kelden, are they just trying to get some extra cash or is this a genuine attempt at innovation?

Kelden:  yeah I know what you mean! So apparently the idea behind it is that IKEA wants to showcase potential career opportunities for young people and maybe even convert them into real-life job prospects.

Emily:  Ah, interesting approach! It's like they're trying to gamify their recruitment process or something. But seriously though, do we think this will actually work? I mean, are teenagers really going to be excited about working in a virtual store just because it pays better than minimum wage?

Kelden:  And some people on Reddit were saying that maybe this could even benefit folks with disabilities who can't get out and around easily

Emily:  That's an amazing point! It never occurred to me, but yeah, for those individuals who have mobility issues or other challenges, being able to work remotely in a virtual environment like Roblox would be incredibly empowering. I mean, it's not just about the pay, it's about having opportunities that might otherwise seem inaccessible.

Kelden:  Yeah and some people were talking about how this is kinda similar to Second Life...

Emily:  Oh man, now you're taking me back! Remember when everyone thought virtual worlds like Second Life would change everything? I guess we can say IKEA's Roblox store is the latest iteration of that idea. But let's be real, it does raise some questions - are they just trying to make a quick buck or do they actually care about creating something meaningful for their customers and employees alike?

Kelden:  And then there were comments saying this was like training AI...

Emily:  Whoa, hold up! Training AI with human laborers in virtual environments is some next-level stuff right here. I'm not sure if that's the intention behind IKEA's move or just a side effect of their innovative approach, but either way it raises so many questions about job displacement and what kind of future we're heading towards

Kelden:  And then there were comments saying this was all an advertising gimmick...

Emily:  Ahahahaha! Oh man, the skepticism is real on Reddit. I love how people are calling out IKEA's motives - Ready for immediate mass production indeed? It sounds like they're trying to create a buzz around their brand rather than actually revolutionizing retail or employment opportunities

Kelden:  yeah and some folks were saying it was just gonna be a few select individuals working in the virtual store...

Emily:  Yeah, I saw that too. So maybe this isn't going to change the world after all? Maybe they're just trying to create a niche marketing opportunity rather than actually disrupting the retail landscape

Kelden:  Alright Emily let's move on to our next topic!

Emily:  Sounds good to me! What've we got lined up for number two, Kelden? Oh wait, I think it starts with Chinese battery developer announces latest cell technology... Ahahahaha, this one sounds juicy already!

Kelden:  Yeah and the company claims they can charge their batteries from 10% to almost full in under 10 minutes...

Emily:  Whoa, that's insane! So we're talking about a significant jump forward in battery tech. I mean, charging an EV from 0-80% in like what, half an hour? That would be game-changing for road trips and daily commutes

Kelden:  And the company is planning to roll out this technology by 2027...

Emily:  Hold up, that's fast! So they're promising mass production of these super-fast-charging batteries within a few years. I'm curious - have we seen any breakthroughs in battery tech recently? Or are there still some major hurdles to overcome before widespread adoption

Kelden:  yeah and the company is saying it'll be ready for commercial availability by 2030...

Emily:  Ah, so they're planning ahead! Commercial viability usually takes a while after mass production starts. I'm wondering what kind of infrastructure changes we might see in terms of charging stations or even city planning to accommodate this new tech

Kelden:  And some commenters were saying that it's not just about the battery itself but also how efficient it is...

Emily:  Ah, good point! Efficiency plays a huge role when you're talking about widespread adoption. I mean, if these batteries can charge faster and last longer while still being cost-effective for consumers, then we might be looking at some serious game-changers in the EV space

Kelden:  yeah exactly Emily...

Emily:  So it's not just about having a new battery tech, but also how well-integrated with existing infrastructure and consumer needs. What do you think Kelden - will this technology finally make electric vehicles mainstream? Or is there still some major roadblock we haven't considered yet

Kelden:  And one last topic...

Emily:  Ooh, I love a good finale! Which subreddit post are we wrapping up with today, buddy?

Kelden:  It's the third and final topic - Chinese battery developer announces latest cell technology capable of reaching almost full charge in under 10 minutes... 

Emily:  Ahahahaha, déjà vu much?! Alright, let's dive back into it then! So we're talking about this Gemstone battery tech that can reach nearly full capacity in less than 10 minutes. What do you think the implications are for electric vehicles and our daily lives?

Kelden:  yeah I mean...

Emily:   Oh man, come on Kelden! You were doing so well with your witty remarks earlier!  Let's wrap up this episode of ReddiPod by saying thanks to all the amazing commenters who shared their thoughts on these topics. From Ikea's virtual store to super-fast charging batteries - it was a wild ride today!

Kelden:   Yeah, sorry about that Emily...

Emily:  No worries buddy!  And finally, let me shout out our Reddit posters and commentators for making this podcast possible;  @LigerXT5 @jimriendeau senortipton  Thanks again to all of you! Join us next time on ReddiPod as we dive into more fascinating topics from the world wide web.

Kelden:   Alright, that's it...

Emily:
